# Krishnaik_ML_course

## This is an end to end datascience project.

## setup.py
The setup.py file is essential for packaging and distributing your Python project. It contains key information about your project, such as its name, version, and author. This file allows others to easily install your project using package managers like pip.
### Use:
Easy Installation: Users can install your project with a simple command, making it accessible to others.
Dependency Management: It helps specify any external libraries your project needs, ensuring users have everything required to run your code.

## .gitignore
The .gitignore file is used to specify which files or directories Git should ignore when you commit your code. This is particularly useful for excluding files that are not necessary for your project, such as temporary files, logs, or sensitive information.
### Use:
Cleaner Repositories: By ignoring unnecessary files, your repository remains clean and focused on the important code.
Security: It helps prevent sensitive information (like API keys or passwords) from being accidentally shared in the repository.

## requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file lists all the external packages that your project depends on. This file allows others to quickly install the necessary packages using a single command.
### Use:
Simplified Setup: New users can set up your project environment easily by installing all required packages at once.
Version Control: By specifying package versions, it ensures that everyone uses the same versions, reducing compatibility issues and bugs.

## Artifacts Folder
The artifacts folder contains important files created by the machine learning scripts.
### Contents:
**raw_data.csv**: Original datasets used for training and testing./n
**test_data.csv**: Datasets for evaluating model performance.
**train_data.csv**: Datasets used to train the models.
**transformed.pkl**: Processed data ready for training.
**model.pkl**: The trained machine learning model.
These files are essential for running and understanding the machine learning projects.
